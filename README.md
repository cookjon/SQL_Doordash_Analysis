# SQL_Doordash_Queries
Using basic to advanced SQL queries, I explored Doordash orders across January and February 2015 via this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dharun4772/doordash-eta-prediction/data

My analysis was performed with PostgreSQL. My set of queries is organized by the subject of analysis and is organized in the following order: 
 - Data Cleaning
 - Store
 - Food
 - Time
